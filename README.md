I'm Ashley, a computer science student, creative programmer and designer. 

I love to build both fun and intuitive things. When I'm not *coding*, you can find me video editing, drawing pixel art, at the gym or making tech-related content

· [Starlit](https://github.com/ashuhlee/starlit) - A customizable and aesthetic weather forecasts designed for your terminal

#### Nerd corner 🍡
